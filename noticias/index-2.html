                    NEW YORK — Of all the emotions a teary-eyed Novak Djokovic felt Sunday as he sat in his chair, watching a stage get constructed for someone else to accept the trophy he came here to win, the most interesting was relief.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course he was sad about losing the U.S. Open final decisively to Daniil Medvedev, about failing to grab the opportunity of a lifetime to complete the calendar-year Grand Slam. And as he said on the stage to the New York crowd that had once given him the cold shoulder, he was genuinely touched by the way they finally embraced him in this final and tried to lift him to come back one more time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it says something about the weight of what Djokovic was trying to accomplish that relief was on his mind Sunday. If the most clutch player in the history of men's tennis could not overcome the pressure of trying to win the Grand Slam, it’s hard to believe any man will. If a player who has pulled off so many miracles from match point down and whose focus intensifies when his competitors fall apart couldn’t bring it when he got this close, Rod Laver’s 52-year-old achievement in the men’s game is probably safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I was glad it was over,” a still emotional Djokovic said 45 minutes after the match ended. “Because the buildup for this tournament and everything that mentally, emotionally I had to deal with throughout the tournament the last couple weeks was a lot. It was a lot to handle.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the larger context of tennis history, the concept of winning the four most important tournaments of the year as a Holy Grail achievement is a relatively new one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until the 1980s, a lot of top players on both the men's and women’s side either skipped the Australian Open or played it infrequently. For a stretch in the 1970s shortly after tennis became a professional sport, Chris Evert and several other top players chose playing World Team Tennis over the French Open. When Steffi Graf won all four majors in 1988 at age 19, the lead story in the New York Times framed her U.S. Open as a legitimizing victory for the 10-year-old Billie Jean King National Tennis Center which was described as “a much maligned byproduct of professional tennis, a place where money, not tradition, has counted most.”
